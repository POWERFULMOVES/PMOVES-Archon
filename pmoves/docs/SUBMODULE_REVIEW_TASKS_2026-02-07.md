## HIGH PRIORITY

### Task #38: PMOVES-DoX Security Review ✅ COMPLETED

**Commit:** `bdd1f82c`
**Message:** security: Hardened authentication and input validation (fixes #86)
**Type:** ~~Security fix~~ **DO NOT MERGE - Removes authentication**

**Analysis Complete:**
- Despite "security" in title, this commit **REMOVES** JWT authentication
- Removes `get_current_user` from protected endpoints
- Deletes security documentation from SECURITY.md
- Hardened branch already has proper security

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT MERGE** - This is a security regression, not a fix.

        "\n",
        "**A prosody-first streaming TTS notebook for Piper that sounds human at ultra-low latency**\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Human Audio Sidecar** is a production-ready Google Colab notebook that upgrades *any* Piper TTS voice with a “human speech” layer—without retraining the model. Instead of synthesizing an entire paragraph at once (high latency) or chopping text into arbitrary 5-word blocks (robotic cadence), this Sidecar analyzes the text like a speaker would: it finds natural prosodic boundaries (sentences, clauses, phrases, and breath points), then streams audio in intelligently timed chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What it does\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implements three synthesis modes and compares them side-by-side:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Baseline TTS**: synthesizes the full text in one pass (good prosody, slower time-to-first-sound).\n",
        "* **Naive Sidecar**: splits text into fixed word blocks and crossfades (fast, but choppy and unnatural).\n",
        "* **Prosodic Sidecar (Human Mode)**: splits text by meaning and breath, then stitches with natural pauses, breath simulation, and energy smoothing (fast *and* natural).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why it sounds more human\n",
        "\n",
        "Human speech isn’t “5 words then pause.” It’s shaped by punctuation, clause boundaries, thought groups, and breathing. This Sidecar reproduces that by:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Prosodic chunking**: breaks text at punctuation, clause markers, and phrase-starters (e.g., “however,” “because,” “finally”).\n",
        "* **Ultra-low TTFS**: the first chunk is intentionally tiny (default **2 words**) so audio starts almost immediately.\n",
        "* **Natural pauses**: pauses vary by boundary type (sentence > clause > phrase).\n",
        "* **Breath simulation**: subtle filtered-noise breaths appear at realistic spots with controlled probability.\n",
        "* **Energy smoothing + crossfades**: avoids audible clicks and harsh joins between chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What’s inside (high-level)\n",
        "\n",
        "* A **prosody parser** that labels boundaries (`SENTENCE`, `CLAUSE`, `PHRASE`, `BREATH`, `NONE`) and estimates syllables to inject breath points when text has no natural breaks.\n",
        "* A **stitching engine** that chooses between:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * boundary-aware pause + optional breath + smoothed re-entry, or\n",
        "  * tight crossfade when no pause is warranted.\n",
        "* A **streaming generator** (`prosodic_stream`) that yields audio as soon as each chunk is ready (useful for real-time voice applications).\n",
        "* An **evaluation harness** that writes WAV files for each method and prints TTFS + total runtime so you can *hear* and *measure* the difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Who this is for\n",
        "\n",
        "If you’re building voice agents, phone-call bots, or real-time narration and you care about both:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **TTFS under ~100ms**, and\n",
        "* **“doesn’t sound like a robot”**\n",
        "  …this notebook is the practical bridge.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to use\n",
        "\n",
        "In Colab:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Install requirements (`espeak-ng`, `piper-tts`, `soundfile`, `numpy`, `scipy`).\n",
        "2. Run the notebook to download a Piper voice (one-time).\n",
        "3. Edit `test_texts` (or plug in your own text stream).\n",
        "4. Listen to the generated WAVs and compare baseline vs naive vs prosodic.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output:** The notebook produces `.wav` samples and a printed performance summary, plus a readable chunking breakdown so you can see exactly *where* and *why* it pauses/breathes."
